- Model architecture for single agent deterministic game which can trained without prior human knowledge about the rules and strategies..
- Main Contributions:
  - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
 Solve the exploitation vs exploration dilemma.
  - The use of Representation, Prediction and Dynamic function
  - Prediction functon $f$,
    - predicts policy and value, $p_t$ and $v_t$
  - Dynamic function $g$,
    - given the current state and action taken, $s_t$ and $a_{t+1}$
    - predicts the next state and immediate reward, $s_{t+1}$ and $r_{t+1}$
  - Representation function $h$,
    - convert current state to latent space, $s_t$
- Cons:
  - Only can learn in an environment with relatively small action space

- Combination of policy evaluation and policy improvement (both can be called policy iteration)
