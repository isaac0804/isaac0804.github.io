<!-- ## Common Mathematical Olympiad Competitions -->

## MC-based Competitions

MC stands for Multiple Choice. This is a pretty straight forward format because it is just like examinations in school but with slightly advance topics.

- [KMC](https://www.kangaroomath.com.my/) (Kangaroo Math Competition)
- [IMONST 1](https://imo-malaysia.org/imonst1/) (International Mathematical Olympiad National Selection Test)
  - organized by Committee under Ministry of Education of Malaysia, that is why this test is different to many other competitions organized by other for-profit organizations.
  - aims to select students to represent Malaysia to compete in competitions,, e.g TOT, APMO, and IMO.
- [SASMO](https://smo-testing.com/sasmo/) (Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad)
  - [SMO Education Group](https://smo-testing.com/) organised many competitions and SASMO is one of the most valueable competitions in my opinion as it leads to SIMOC, AIMO, and IJMO.
- [AIMO](https://smo-testing.com/aimo/) (Asia International Mathematical Olympiad)
  - One of the common International MO competitions, consists of two rounds, trial and final.
  - Medalists of SASMO will be invited to join AIMO final.
- [陈景润杯中学数学竞赛 Chen Jing Run's Cup Secondary School Mathematical Competition](https://mathcompetition.wixsite.com/chenjingrun)
  - organized by Xiamen University Malaysia
  - for secondary school students only and must register through school
- ASMO (Asian Science and Maths Olympiad)
  - I don't recommend this competition because of the poor management and rude attitude. [Some Comments about ASMO](https://www.change.org/p/ministry-of-education-change-the-organiser-of-asmo-asian-science-and-maths-olympiad-competition)
  - Their past year question sets are pretty terrible too, contain a lot of mistakes and not well-explained at all. Definitely not worth the penny.

## Proof-based Compeitions

This type of competitions is typically harder since and it requires proof writing and takes longer period of time, normally 3 to 4.5 hours.

- [IMONST 2](https://imo-malaysia.org/imonst-2/) (International Mathematical Olympiad National Selection Test)
- TOT (Tournament of Towns)
- [APMO](https://www.apmo-official.org/) (Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad)
- [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/) (International Mathematical Olympiad)
