## Introduction

A lot of people asked me, "Can you teach me how to code?"
My answer is always, "What do you want to do with coding?"
Coding is similar to playing music. 
You need to learn a music instrument to begin with.
You started by learning how to play notes, how to read notations and stuff.
After you got the basic, you proceed to play pieces, pop songs you love.
Programmers start by learning basics of a language, then continue with small exciting projects 

In this blogpost, I would like to provide my approach in learning coding and provide resources for different fields.
