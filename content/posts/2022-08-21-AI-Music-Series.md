## Music Generative Model

This is a project I've been thinking about for a while and now I decided to start working on it.
The aim is to generate piano music using a generative model.
The reason why I decided to limit the scope of the project to piano music is that I play piano and I understand piano more than other instruments.

In addition, piano is a wide pitch range and polyphonic instrument so it can imitate most of the instruments. Except this...

Anyway, there is a lot of potential of piano music generation.
One of the possible use case in the future is to generate piano music cover of a song even there are a lot of instruments and vocal involved.
For example, [Animenz](https://www.youtube.com/c/Animenzzz) is a YouTube channel that uploads his piano music cover of anime songs.
His arrangement is insanely good and I think it will be cool if the model can reach this level(or even half).

The reason why I started this blog series is to document the progress of my research and share my thoughts with others. So to avoid the situation where I can't finish the project, I will post the outcome on the Internet by the end of October, whether it is good or bad.

In the next blog post I will dive into some of technical details of the project. Stay tuned!

## Updates from Future

Seems like I gave up documenting this project due to many events in my life. 
Everything is fine, just that it is harder for me to squeeze out time for it.
I did work on this project but I found it very hard to do it on my local environment (limited storage space and 4GB VRAM).
I believe that I will still continue this project in the future, and I am looking forward to use cloud GPU for experimenting and testing by that time

There is a discussion thread in EleutherAI discord group about symbolic music generation. Check it out if anyone is interested.
