Note that G is fixed for each layer and each group has its learned latent features of shape K x D where K is number of latent vectors and D is number of latent vector channel.\nIn each group, input data is cross attended to latent vectors to form output of shape K x D.\nThe output of cross attention is then attended through a few layers of (Self Attention and MLP, ie typical Transformer Layer).\nThe output of each group is then merged and be the input of next block.\nInput data is flatten, yes reshape to 1-D, this works for all modalilty of data and preserves part of the locality.\nResults Although it is not SOTA on ImageNet, but the performance is not far behind, consider SOTA models have large hand-crafted layers specifically for images. Flattening or Local structure is important. MAE learn rich low-dimensional positional embeddings. Classification is a sparsely supervised downstream task which is not sufficient for model to learn rich representation unlike MAE. For point cloud data, pretraining using MAE yields much better result although no visible structure is observed in the learned positional embedding.

Some Comments about ASMO Their past year question sets are pretty terrible too, contain a lot of mistakes and not well-explained at all. Definitely not worth the penny.

I really enjoyed it and part of the reason is that I could get praised by my parents. I was happy and cosidered myself as a clever kid.\nMany years later, when I was attempting to IMO training camp in Semenanjung Malaysia, I soon realized there are lots of kid better than me. At some point, I felt regret for not improving much after my Primary 2. I questioned myself why I am not as good as they are. In my opinion, there could be two main factors:\nOppurtunity Gap and Lack of Vision. (I will write another post discussing about oppurtunity gap in the future) I have no idea there is a thing called Mathematical Olympiad until I was thirteen years old. I have no idea what is mathematics beyond Additional Mathematics. I have no idea what is programming and all other good stuff. The situation of asymmetric information and lack of guidance made me stop improving. Other than that, in some of the coutries, students can skip grade if they are \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;. But it is not common to skip grade in my country (at least I never saw a case), so I kinda lost the oppurtunity to save some of my time.\nI am just not hardworking enough, because my mindset told me I can do most of the thing easily, which sets up to the failure. This is the reason why I think this video reveals the truth. Gifted kids are actually Special Needs\nWhat are the problems Gifted kids lose their oppurtunities to develop their study habits when they are young. It is counter-intuitive for the gifted kids to study when the syllabus is too easy for them. Sometimes, some of the homeworks are just too easy for them and they quickly find study boring. Most of the time, they tend to study only few days before the exam. Other way of speaking, they train themselves to pass the exam using their raw intellect. When the syllabus become harder as they grew up, they do not equipped with the proper study habit that they need and their raw intellect can no longer compete with other students. As a result, they hit a wall later in their life. This strikes their confidence because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t match with their imagination.\nWe assume gifted kids can achieve something easier than others, but forgot what it really takes to live up the high expectations by parents or teachers. We forget that in order to achieve a greater goal, it takes more effort, which is not what gifted kids do in an environment that is considered relatively simple to them.\nWhat are the consequences The distance between expectations and reality forms a embarrasing gap in gifted kid\u0026rsquo;s mind. How to help gifted kids For gifted kids:\nLive up to the expectations Lower down the expectations For supporters:\nGive them bigger challenge and have faith in them.

NEVER say no enough time For the sake of your marks, do not say you dont have enough time. All the contestants have the same amount of time and it is sufficient to build a good enough prototype / product. This line just exposed the poor time management of your team to the judges.\n2. Understand clearly the judging criteria for the competition Knowing the judging criteria can come in handy when you are deciding what information should be included in the presentation. The presentation time is often short, you want to catch judges\u0026rsquo; attention and give them the information they want. If there is a part of the marks allocated for the code, make sure you show some of it (maybe the core parts) in your presentation.\nIf the judging criteria is unclear, here is some information you want to include:\nProblem to be solved State the problem statement clearly, be specific Enough data to prove the existence and negative effects of the problem. Solutions Explain your solution clearly Reasons of why this solution can solve the problem (Optional) Feedback from users / professionals (Optional) Future improvements If you have a lot of data but presentation time is too short, include the strongest one in your presentation and put the rest in the slides. You might want to pull out some in the QnA section.\n3. Don\u0026rsquo;t put all fancy technology It is common to see a team to add solar panel, camera, 3d printing ideas into their project. However, sometime these only contribute to the \u0026ldquo;fanciness\u0026rdquo; rather than usefulness. Try to think more about these additions, consider the cost, the maintenance, and the safety. A great design is not full of different thing, but about simple. (cannot take away something)\n4. Business model Think about the revenue, the sustainability of the whole project. We don\u0026rsquo;t want burn money on something that looks good, but can\u0026rsquo;t sustain in the long run.\n","permalink":"https://isaac0804.github.io/posts/2021-11-02-innovation-competitions-tips-and-tricks/","summary":"Some of my thoughts when watching MyGeekathon Final 2021.\n1.
