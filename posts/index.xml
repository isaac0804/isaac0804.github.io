Fourier embeddings must be adjust to fit the modality of data and become memory bottleneck when dealing with high dimensional data Novelties This paper shows that by introducing some degree of locality, it can improve the efficiency of perceiver model. Masked Auto-Encodign(MAE) plays a mojor role in learning positional embeddings Architecture Input data is assumed to be processed such that it is in a shape of M x C where M is number of tokens and C is number of channels</description></item><item><title>MuZero Note</title><link>https://isaac0804.github.io/posts/2022-08-21-muzero/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 14:48:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://isaac0804.github.io/posts/2022-08-21-muzero/</guid><description>Model architecture for single agent deterministic game which can trained without prior human knowledge about the rules and strategies..

The use of Representation, Prediction and Dynamic function Prediction functon $f$, predicts policy and value, $p_t$ and $v_t$ Dynamic function $g$, given the current state and action taken, $s_t$ and $a_{t+1}$ predicts the next state and immediate reward, $s_{t+1}$ and $r_{t+1}$ Representation function $h$, convert current state to latent space, $s_t$ Cons:</description></item><item><title>Mathematical Competitions in Malaysia</title><link>https://isaac0804.github.io/posts/2021-02-01-mo-competitions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://isaac0804.github.io/posts/2021-02-01-mo-competitions/</guid><description>MC-based Competitions MC stands for Multiple Choice. This is a pretty straight forward format because it is just like examinations in school but with slightly advance topics.

This is a summary of a video I watched few days ago, which made me ponder for a while.
Background When I was in Primary 2, I took my mom&amp;rsquo;s textbook and started doing Additional Mathematics out of curiosity. I really enjoyed it and part of the reason is that I could get praised by my parents. I was happy and cosidered myself as a clever kid.</description></item><item><title>Innovation Competitions Tips and Tricks</title><link>https://isaac0804.github.io/posts/2021-11-02-innovation-competitions-tips-and-tricks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://isaac0804.github.io/posts/2021-11-02-innovation-competitions-tips-and-tricks/</guid><description>Some of my thoughts when watching MyGeekathon Final 2021.
1. NEVER say no enough time For the sake of your marks, do not say you dont have enough time. All the contestants have the same amount of time and it is sufficient to build a good enough prototype / product. This line just exposed the poor time management of your team to the judges.
2. Understand clearly the judging criteria for the competition Knowing the judging criteria can come in handy when you are deciding what information should be included in the presentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
